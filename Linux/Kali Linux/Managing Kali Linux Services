Service Management
-------------------
service is a wrapper around existing system init scripts located in /etc/init.d/ directory. Another way of managing the service, you can directly use the init scripts.

    /etc/init.d/ssh start
    /etc/init.d/ssh stop



Service Boot Persistence
------------------------
Services will be started at boot time.

    update-rc.d ssh enable or systemctl enable ssh
    update-rc.d ssh disable or systemctl disable ssh

For more granular control of these services, use rcconf or sysv-rc-conf, both to help simplify and manage the boot persistence of these services.
