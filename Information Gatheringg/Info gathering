Reconnaissance
Active Intelligence Gathering

Under this method, the targeted organization may become aware of the ongoing reconnaissance process since the pentester is actively engaging with the target. During this phase, he takes an active part in mapping network infrastructure, then he enumerates and/or scans the open services for vulnerabilities, and eventually searches for unpublished directories, files and servers. Other similar activities include OS Fingerprinting, Banner grabbing, and Web server application scan.

    Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network, thus building a "map" of the network. https://github.com/nmap/nmap
    dnsrecon a tool DNS Enumeration Script. https://github.com/darkoperator/dnsrecon
    EyeWitness is designed to take screenshots of websites, provide some server header info, and identify default credentials if possible. https://github.com/ChrisTruncer/EyeWitness
    AWSBucketDump is a tool to quickly enumerate AWS S3 buckets to look for loot. https://github.com/jordanpotti/AWSBucketDump
    AQUATONE is a set of tools for performing reconnaissance on domain names. https://github.com/michenriksen/aquatone
    spoofcheck a program that checks if a domain can be spoofed from. The program checks SPF and DMARC records for weak configurations that allow spoofing. https://github.com/BishopFox/spoofcheck

Passive Intelligence Gathering

This option is under discussion provided that there is an explicit demand for the gathering activities not to be detected by the target. In this regard, the pentester cannot use tools that send traffic to the targeted company neither from his host nor an “anonymous” one across the Internet. Not only will that be technically burdening but also the person who performs the pentest will have to substantiate his findings with whatever he can dig out from archived or stored information, which is at times not up to date and incorrect because it has been limited to inquiries collected from third parties.

    linkScrape A LinkedIn user/company enumeration tool. https://github.com/NickSanzotta/linkScrape
    FOCA (Fingerprinting Organizations with Collected Archives) is a tool used mainly to find metadata and hidden information in the documents its scans. https://github.com/ElevenPaths/FOCA
    theHarvester is a tool for gathering subdomain names, e-mail addresses, virtual hosts, open ports/ banners, and employee names from different public sources. https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester
    Metagoofil is a tool for extracting metadata of public documents (pdf,doc,xls,ppt,etc) availables in the target websites. https://github.com/laramies/metagoofil
    Social Mapper OSINT Social Media Mapping Tool, takes a list of names & images (or LinkedIn company name) and performs automated target searching on a huge scale across multiple social media sites. Not restricted by APIs as it instruments a browser using Selenium. Outputs reports to aid in correlating targets across sites. https://github.com/SpiderLabs/social_mapper
    skiptracer OSINT scraping framework, utilizes some basic python webscraping (BeautifulSoup) of PII paywall sites to compile passive information on a target on a ramen noodle budget. https://github.com/xillwillx/skiptracer
    typofinder a finder of domain typos showing country of IP address. https://github.com/nccgroup/typofinder
    pwnedOrNot is a python script which checks if the email account has been compromised in a data breach, if the email account is compromised it proceeds to find passwords for the compromised account. https://github.com/thewhiteh4t/pwnedOrNot

Frameworks

In computer programming, a software framework is an abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software. A software framework provides a standard way to build and deploy applications.

    Maltego is a unique platform developed to deliver a clear threat picture to the environment that an organization owns and operates. https://www.paterva.com/web7/downloads.php
    SpiderFoot the open source footprinting and intelligence-gathering tool. https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot
    datasploit is an OSINT Framework to perform various recon techniques on Companies, People, Phone Number, Bitcoin Addresses, etc., aggregate all the raw data, and give data in multiple formats. https://github.com/DataSploit/datasploit
    Recon-ng is a full-featured Web Reconnaissance framework written in Python. https://bitbucket.org/LaNMaSteR53/recon-ng

Social Engineering in the Context of Intelligence Gathering

Social engineering is deemed one of the most widespread avenues for gathering information on a particular individual or a firm. A lot of information is out there – just check the popular social media websites. Also, websites like Pipl, PeekYou, and Spokeo may come in handy as they will provide access to email addresses, locations, phone numbers, and even family tree information.
