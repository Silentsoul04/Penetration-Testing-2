Putting It All Together
------------------------
▪ You’ve collected examples of emails, names, phone numbers, servers’ addresses, documents, presentations, and more 
▪ Use the emails to draft potential spearphishing emails to be more realistic 
● Use target’s PDF, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files to embed malware 
● Use real employee names, positions, and writing styles to mimic real email traffic 

Taking It Further… 
▪ Use domain name squatting 
● Targeting titancipher.com by using titancypher.com 
● Make the site look as close to the original as possible but host malware there 
▪ Identify any subdomains (developer sites, mail servers, etc.) for exploitation
