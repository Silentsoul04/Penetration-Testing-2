--[ 3 - Stay safe out there ]---------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, our world is backwards. You get rich by doing bad things and go
to jail for doing good. Fortunately, thanks to the hard work of people like
the Tor project [1], you can avoid going to jail by taking a few simple
precautions:

1) Encrypt your hard disk [2]

   I guess when the police arrive to seize your computer, it means you've
   already made a lot of mistakes, but it's better to be safe.

2) Use a virtual machine with all traffic routed through Tor

   This accomplishes two things. First, all your traffic is anonymized through
   Tor. Second, keeping your personal life and your hacking on separate
   computers helps you not to mix them by accident.

   You can use projects like Whonix [3], Tails [4], Qubes TorVM [5], or
   something custom [6]. Here's [7] a detailed comparison.

3) (Optional) Don't connect directly to Tor
   
   Tor isn't a panacea. They can correlate the times you're connected to Tor
   with the times your hacker handle is active. Also, there have been
   successful attacks against Tor [8]. You can connect to Tor using other
   peoples' wifi. Wifislax [9] is a linux distro with a lot of tools for
   cracking wifi. Another option is to connect to a VPN or a bridge node [10]
   before Tor, but that's less secure because they can still correlate the
   hacker's activity with your house's internet activity (this was used as
   evidence against Jeremy Hammond [11]).

   The reality is that while Tor isn't perfect, it works quite well. When I
   was young and reckless, I did plenty of stuff without any protection (I'm
   referring to hacking) apart from Tor, that the police tried their hardest
   to investigate, and I've never had any problems.
