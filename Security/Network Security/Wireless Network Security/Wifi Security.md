## Wireless Threats & Vulnerabilities
    - Rogue Access Points/Ad-Hoc Networks
    - Denial of Service & Distributed Denial of Service
    - Configuration Problems (Mis-Configurations/Incomplete Configurations)
    - Passive Capturing
    - Identity Theft (MAC Spoofing)
    - Session Hijacking
    - Evil Twin APs
    - Replay Attack
    - Dictionary & Brute  Force  Attack
    - WEP/WPA/WPA2 Weaknesses

## Wireless Security Testing
    - Identifying Wi-Fi networks, including wireless fingerprinting, information leakage and signal leakage
    - Determining encryption weaknesses, such as encryption cracking, wireless sniffing and session hijacking
    - Identifying opportunities to penetrate a network by using wireless or evading WLAN access control measures
    - Identifying legitimate usersâ€™ identities and credentials to access otherwise private networks and services
 
## Benefits of Wireless Security Testing
    - Get real-world insight into your vulnerabilities.
    - Detect default Wi-Fi routers & Identify insecure wireless encryption standards (such as WEP).
    - Identify rogue or open access points.
    - Spot misconfigured or accidentally duplicated wireless networks.
    - Flag security vulnerabilities in Bluetooth technology.
 
## Wireless Secure Configuration and Network Isolation (Users can minimize the risk of attacks in their networks by)
    - Changing default Wi-Fi network names (SSIDs) and passwords
    - Updating the firmware of Wi-Fi-enabled devices, routers, and other hardware 
    - Enabling the firewall for added security in devices
    - Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) especially when remotely accessing assets

## Wireless Secure Configuration and Network Isolation (For businesses, the crucial mitigation is for the IT department to have stringent policies in place, such as)
    - Raising company awareness on the risks related issues
    - Employing network monitoring to oversee connected devices and web traffic.
    - Regularly reviewing device logs and monitoring results for any suspicious activity. 
    - Using authentication tools, such as two-factor authentication

## Security Settings for a Router 

    - Turn off WPS (WiFi Protected Setup)
    - Disable 2.4 GHz Frequency if possible
    - Only connect to a router with a device (smartphone, tablet, laptop) that is an 802.11ac device.
    - Enable WPA2 / WPA3 encryption and put in a long password.
    - Weaken the WiFi signal if possible.
    - Never input passwords or usernames into a pop-up. Always go directly to a router admin-page to enter usernames and          passwords.  
    - Change the routers default admin-page log-in username/password.
    - Update the firmware of the router
    - Change the SSID broadcast name.
