Wireless Threats & Vulnerabilities
 - Rogue Access Points/Ad-Hoc Networks
 - Denial of Service & Distributed Denial of Service
 - Configuration Problems (Mis-Configurations/Incomplete Configurations)
 - Passive Capturing
 - Identity Theft (MAC Spoofing)
 - Session Hijacking
 - Evil Twin APs
 - Replay Attack
 - Dictionary & Brute  Force  Attack
 - WEP/WPA/WPA2 Weaknesses

Wireless Security Testing
 - Identifying Wi-Fi networks, including wireless fingerprinting, information leakage and signal leakage
 - Determining encryption weaknesses, such as encryption cracking, wireless sniffing and session hijacking
 - Identifying opportunities to penetrate a network by using wireless or evading WLAN access control measures
 - Identifying legitimate usersâ€™ identities and credentials to access otherwise private networks and services
 
Benefits of Wireless Security Testing
 - Get real-world insight into your vulnerabilities.
 - Detect default Wi-Fi routers & Identify insecure wireless encryption standards (such as WEP).
 - Identify rogue or open access points.
 - Spot misconfigured or accidentally duplicated wireless networks.
 - Flag security vulnerabilities in Bluetooth technology.
 
Wireless Secure Configuration and Network Isolation (Users can minimize the risk of attacks in their networks by)
 - Changing default Wi-Fi network names (SSIDs) and passwords
 - Updating the firmware of Wi-Fi-enabled devices, routers, and other hardware 
 - Enabling the firewall for added security in devices
 - Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) especially when remotely accessing assets

Wireless Secure Configuration and Network Isolation (For businesses, the crucial mitigation is for the IT department to have stringent policies in place, such as)
 - Raising company awareness on the risks related issues
 - Employing network monitoring to oversee connected devices and web traffic.
 - Regularly reviewing device logs and monitoring results for any suspicious activity. 
 - Using authentication tools, such as two-factor authentication
