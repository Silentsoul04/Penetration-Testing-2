What Firewall Does?
--------------------
All packets entering or leaving the intranet must pass through the firewall, which examines each message and blocks those that do not meet the specified security criteria.
 - Defend Resources
 - Validate Access
 - Manage and Control Network Traffic
 - Record and Report on Events
 - Act as an Intermediary
 
How Does a Firewall Work?
---------------------------
Examines all traffic routed between the two networks to see if it meets certain criteria.
Firewall filters both inbound and outbound traffic.
Can filter packets based on their source and destination addresses and port numbers.
For example, “Source address 172.18.1.1   is allowed to reach destination 172.18.2.1 over port 22.“

Firewall Rules
---------------
Accept new and established incoming traffic to the public network interface on port 80 and 443 (HTTP and HTTPS web traffic)
Drop incoming traffic from IP addresses of the non-technical employees in your office to port 22 (SSH)
Reject new and established incoming traffic from your office IP range to the private network interface on port 22 (SSH)

Drop means to block the traffic and send no reply
Reject means to block the traffic but reply with an "unreachable" error
Accept means to allow the traffic


Types of Firewalls
-------------------
 1.Packet-Filtering Firewalls
 Packet Filtering Firewalls are normally Deployed on the Routers which connect the Internal Network to Internet. 
 Packet Filtering Firewalls can only be Implemented on the Network Layer of OSI Model.
 
 Second Generation Firewall (Stateful Inspection Firewall)
 It is also known as ‘Dynamic Packet Filters’.
 A stateful inspection firewall allows or blocks traffic based on state, port, and protocol. 
 This firewall works at layer 4 (Transport Layer) of the OSI model.
 
 Third Generation Firewall (Application Layer Firewall)
 Application layer firewall can inspect and filter the packets on any OSI layer, up to Application Layer. 
 It has ability to block specific content, also recognize when certain application and protocols (like HTTP, FTP) are being misused.
 Application Layer Firewall may also be called Proxy Firewall or Gateway Firewall.
 
 Circuit-Level Gateways
 Circuit-level gateways work at the Session Layer of the OSI model, or as a "shim-layer" between the application layer and the transport layer of the TCP/IP stack.
 A circuit-level gateway monitors TCP handshaking between packets from trusted clients or servers to untrusted hosts and vice versa to determine whether a requested session is legitimate.
 
 Next Generation Firewalls (NGF)
 --------------------------------
 What it Does?
 Provides deep packet inspection to uncover and reroute potentially dangerous traffic.
 
 Why you Need it?
 To enable internal and external traffic segmentation.
 
 Who Makes it?
 Check Point, Cisco, Dell, Barracuda, Fortinet, Juniper, Palo Alto and many others.
 
 Where It's Headed?
 Tighter integration with infrastructure (NSX-v) and security ecosystem (encryption, authentication).
 
Firewall Threats & Vulnerabilities
-------------------------------------
 - Insider Attacks
 - Missed Security Patches
 - Configuration Mistakes
 - A Lack of Deep Packet Inspection
 - DDoS Attacks

Firewall Security Recommendations and Best Practices
 - Know Your Network
 - Form a Firewall Change Control Board 
 - Alert Users and Admins Prior to Firewall Rule Changes
 - Document All Rules and Use Comments to Explain the Purpose of Special Rules
 - Avoid Use of "Any" in Firewall "Allow" Rules
 - "Deny All" First and Then Add Exceptions
 - Review Rules Regularly and Remove Unused Rules on a Regular Basis 
 - Organize Firewall Rules for Performance
