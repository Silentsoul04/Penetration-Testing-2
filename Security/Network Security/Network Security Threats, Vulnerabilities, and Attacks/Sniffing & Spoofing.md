Sniffing Concepts
Packet sniffing is a technology which captures the packets passing through the network in which it is installed. Packet sniffer is a tool which monitors all the network data. Furthermore, it can intercept and log incoming and outgoing traffic across the network.
  - Syslog Traffic
  - Telnet Passwords
  - Router Configuration
  - FTP Passwords
  - DNS Traffic
  - Email Traffic
  - Web Traffic
  - Chat Sessions
  
Protocols Vulnerable to Sniffing
 (HTTP,Telnet,POP,FTP,SNMP,IMAP)
 
Types of Sniffing
   Passive Sniffing
      - This kind of sniffing occurs at the hub. 
      - Passive sniffers placed by the attackers passively wait for the data to be sent and capture them.
   Active Sniffing
      - Sniffing in the switch is active sniffing.
      - In order to capture the traffic between target, sniffers has to actively inject traffic into the LAN to enable sniffing of the traffic.
      - ARP Poisoning | MAC Flooding | DHCP Attacks | DNS Cache Poisoning

Spoofing Network Traffic
    - Email Spoofing
    - Caller ID Spoofing 
    - MAC Spoofing
    - IP Spoofing
    - ARP Spoofing
    - DNS Server Spoofing
