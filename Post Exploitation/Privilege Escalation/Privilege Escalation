Privilege Escalation

Based on the data youâ€™ve obtained from any of the various scripts previously mentioned, you may have found a method for privilege escalation. Whether it be your brute-forced some passwords, found a mis-configuration, abused file permissions etc.

Somethings to look for via the output of the scripts above:

    Process running as root/admin user
    Cracked password. Might just be the same for root/admin
    setuid binaries
    World Read/Write files
    Scheduled Tasks/Cronjobs that can be reconfigured
    User Paths
