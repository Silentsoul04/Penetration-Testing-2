Once youâ€™ve obtained your unauthorized access to a machine via a shell, you will want to start gathering data.

This data should include information about the target:

    Operating System
    All users
    Users with Admin access
    Accessible Files/Folders
    Installed Applications/Binaries/Libraries
    Networking Settings
    Scheduled Tasks/Cron Jobs
    Running Processes/Services

All of this information can be useful to privilege escalation.

In addition to the above, you may want to try and ex-filtrate some useful information like passwords, zip files, configuration files, etc.
