Once youâ€™ve obtained your unauthorized access to a machine via a shell, you will want to start gathering data.

This data should include information about the target:

    Operating System
    All users
    Users with Admin access
    Accessible Files/Folders
    Installed Applications/Binaries/Libraries
    Networking Settings
    Scheduled Tasks/Cron Jobs
    Running Processes/Services

All of this information can be useful to privilege escalation.

In addition to the above, you may want to try and ex-filtrate some useful information like passwords, zip files, configuration files, etc.

Tool - LinEnum: Scripted Local Linux Enumeration & Privilege Escalation Checks
https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum

Tool - LinPrivChecker: This script is intended to be executed locally on a Linux box to enumerate basic system info and search for common privilege escalation vectors such as world writable files, misconfigurations, clear-text passwords and applicable exploits.

Tool - Linux Smart Enumeration: This tool was created after the developer was inspired by LinEnum previously mentioned. This script is more up to date and just looks cleaner than LinEnum and LinPrivChecker.

Tool - PowerUp: PowerUp aims to be a clearinghouse of common Windows privilege escalation vectors that rely on mis-configurations.

Tool - Powerless: A Windows privilege escalation (enumeration) script designed with OSCP labs (i.e. legacy Windows machines without Powershell) in mind. The script represents a conglomeration of various privilege escalation checks, gathered from various sources, all done via native Windows binaries present in almost every version of Windows.
