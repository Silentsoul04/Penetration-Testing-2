Firefox: The passwords are stored in one of the following filenames: signons.txt, signons2.txt, and signons3.txt (depends on Firefox version) These password files are located inside the profile folder of Firefox, in [Windows Profile]

    \Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[Profile Name] 
    
Also, key3.db, located in the same folder, is used for encryption/decription of the passwords. 

IE

Internet Explorer 4.00 - 6.00: 
The passwords are stored in a secret location in the Registry known as the "Protected Storage". The base key of the Protected Storage is located under the following key: "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Protected Storage System Provider". In order to view the subkeys of this key in RegEdit, you must do the same process as explained for the LSA secrets. 
Even when you browse the above key in the Registry Editor (RegEdit), you won't be able to watch the passwords, because they are encrypted. Also, this key cannot easily moved from one computer to another, like you do with regular Registry keys.
IE PassView and Protected Storage PassView utilities allow you to recover these passwords.
 

Internet Explorer 7.00 - 8.00: 
The new versions of Internet Explorer stores the passwords in 2 different locations. AutoComplete passwords are stored in the Registry under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\IntelliForms\Storage2. HTTP Authentication passwords are stored in the Credentials file under Documents and Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Credentials , together with login passwords of LAN computers and other passwords.
IE PassView can be used to recover these passwords.
