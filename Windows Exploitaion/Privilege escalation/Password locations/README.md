IE

Internet Explorer 4.00 - 6.00: 
The passwords are stored in a secret location in the Registry known as the "Protected Storage". The base key of the Protected Storage is located under the following key: "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Protected Storage System Provider". In order to view the subkeys of this key in RegEdit, you must do the same process as explained for the LSA secrets. 
Even when you browse the above key in the Registry Editor (RegEdit), you won't be able to watch the passwords, because they are encrypted. Also, this key cannot easily moved from one computer to another, like you do with regular Registry keys.
IE PassView and Protected Storage PassView utilities allow you to recover these passwords.
 

Internet Explorer 7.00 - 8.00: 
The new versions of Internet Explorer stores the passwords in 2 different locations. AutoComplete passwords are stored in the Registry under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\IntelliForms\Storage2. HTTP Authentication passwords are stored in the Credentials file under Documents and Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Credentials , together with login passwords of LAN computers and other passwords.
IE PassView can be used to recover these passwords.

Windows Network Passwords (XP/Vista/2003): When you connect to the file system of another computer on your network (something like \\MyComp\MyFolder), Windows allows you to save the password. If you choose to save the password, the encrypted password is stored in a credential file. 
The credential file is stored in the following locations:
• Windows XP/2003: [Windows Profile]\Application Data\Microsoft\Credentials\[User SID]\Credentials and [Windows Profile]\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Credentials\[User SID]\Credentials
• Windows Vista: [Windows Profile]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Credentials\[Random ID] and [Windows Profile]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials\[Random ID]
You can use my Network Password Recovery utility to view all passwords stored in these Credentials files.
