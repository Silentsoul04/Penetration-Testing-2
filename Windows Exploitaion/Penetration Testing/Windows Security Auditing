Module I: Introduction 
• Which applications should a user have access to run? 
• Which users should be allowed to install new software? 
• Which versions of applications should be allowed? 
• How are licensed applications controlled? 
 
To meet these challenges, AppLocker provides administrators with the ability to specify which users can run specific applications. AppLocker allows administrators to control the following types of applications: 

• executable files (.exe and .com) 
• scripts (.js, .ps1, .vbs, .cmd, and .bat),  
• Windows Installer files (.msi and .msp), and DLL files (.dll and .ocx).
