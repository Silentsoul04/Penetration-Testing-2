A Red Team should be formed with the intention of identifying and assessing vulnerabilities, testing assumptions, viewing alternate options for attack and revealing the limitations and security risks for that organization. 

There are many benefits to Red Teaming. First, you have a designated group with tactical experience in challenging the security of your organization at all times. This is important to see how your organization will fair against the very same tactics adversaries will hope to deploy on your environment. An effective Red Team: 

* Challenges your organization’s assumptions and identifies faulty logic or flawed analysis.
* Assesses the strength of the evidence base or the quality of your information Identifies alternative options or outcomes and/or explores the consequences of an action or attack plan.
* Tests your system, network, applications and more through the eyes of an adversary.
* Understands the options for an adversary to break into and move throughout your system.

#### Role of a Red Team


This is a designated group that tests the security posture of your organization to see how it will fair against real-time attacks – before it actually happens. Hiring people with different backgrounds and specialties helps to round out your security red team to ensure you are testing and seeing your company form the various perspectives of an attacker. 

Your Red Team should periodically challenge your security measures throughout the year. Primarily their job will be testing your infrastructure to see how it’d hold up against different attack methodologies without giving notice to fellow employees. But also, it’s worthwhile to have your Red Team test your organization after implementing a new security software or program to the mix.

#### Red Team vs. Penetration Tester

Penetration Testers are a must have for any organization. This is a designated person who will ethically hack and evaluate your environment. In this role they will be the point of contact and operate as the brains behind your security scope. 

While it’s good to have someone in place to handle this – keeping up with the number of tests needed is growing to be too much for one individual to handle. The number of attacks are growing and the amount of research and experience that’s required to get ahead of these attacks is increasing the gap between time of attack and time of discovery. That’s where red teaming comes in. Hiring a group of individuals to test and monitor with full visibility into your security posture routinely and consistently better ensures you have the appropriate measures in place to secure your organization.
