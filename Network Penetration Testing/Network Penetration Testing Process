Network Penetration Testing Process (known vulnerabilities)
-----------------------------------------------------------


1. Ping Sweep:
The purpose of this step is to identify live hosts

	nmap -sP <ip-address/ip-range>


2. Port Scan
Identify running services. We use the running services to map the network topology.

	nmap -sS <ip-address/ip-range>


3. Bannergrab
Identify the version of version of software running on each port

	nmap -sV <ip-address/ip-range>
	


4. Vulnerability Research
Use the software version number to research and determine if it is out of date (vulnerable).
